            <p>Colonial Corner is Morristown High School's television show which is produced in its entirety by students.
                Originally airing on Cablevision channel 77 and later over classroom television sets during a one-hour AEP block,
                Colonial Corner made a switch to a YouTube-only platform in 2010.
                Episodes are now produced throughout the school year and are uploaded approximately every three weeks.
                The shows generally feature a lineup of "pieces", ranging in subject,
                with host segments in between to introduce them.
                An opening sequence, bumpers, and credits help to define the show.
